Made this project as my learning journey of React

## Functionalities
  * understand basic Redux with React
  * refactor and use React Toolkit
  * `crateSlice` for crating reducers
  * `useDispatch()` hook for emiting actions from the Views
  * `useSelector()` hook to utilize only the state that we need
